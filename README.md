# Django Template Maker

Building new and replicable projects in Django is tedious and time consuming. This repo builds Django projects that include the most commonly used linting, formatting, and authentication packages. Projects made through this script are created, initialized, built, and validated. I made this for myself because Django is pretty sh*tty when it comes to making new projects and new apps.
