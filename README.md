# Django Template Maker

Building new and replicable projects in Django is tedious and time consuming. This repo builds Django projects that include the most commonly used linting, formatting, and authentication packages. Projects made through this script are created, initialized, built, and validated. I made this for myself because Django is pretty sh*tty when it comes to making new projects and new apps.

To build a project, just clone the repo and run either `build` (on Windows), `./build.sh` (on UNIX), or `make build` (on systems with GCC or Make). You can also click on the scripts themselves to execute them, but you should read through scripts before you blindly execute them. I suppose you can run `build.py` (independent of OS), but that keeps the shell open on completion, and I think that is lame.
